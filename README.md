# Star-Type-Classification
This project classifies stars into various categories based on physical attributes such as temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star color, and spectral class. A Decision Tree classifier is used for this classification, integrated with a Flask-based RESTful API to provide real-time predictions.
