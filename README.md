# Star-Type-Classification
This project classifies stars into various categories based on physical attributes such as temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star color, and spectral class. A Decision Tree classifier is used for this classification, integrated with a Flask-based RESTful API to provide real-time predictions.
📌 Key Features
Machine Learning Model: Decision Tree Classifier (achieved 99.8% accuracy).
API: Flask-based RESTful API for real-time star classification.
GUI: User-friendly interface to input star attributes and get predictions.
Performance Evaluation: Compared Decision Tree with SVM (95%) and KNN (93%) models.
